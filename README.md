# Carbon Tax Analysis

This project explores global carbon tax rates, coverage, and their relationship with CO₂ emissions per capita. The analysis is performed in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

**Data Sources:**

World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard (2023)

Tax Foundation – Carbon Taxes in Europe (2023)

Destatis – Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (2023)

**The dataset includes:**

Country name
Carbon tax rate ($/ton CO₂e)

CO₂ emissions per capita (t per capita)

Year of implementation

**Example Visualizations:**

Barplots: Carbon tax per country

Histograms: CO₂ emissions per capita grouped by tax level

Residual plots: ANOVA model diagnostics

**How to Run**:

Clone or download this repository.

Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook carbon_taxes.ipynb
